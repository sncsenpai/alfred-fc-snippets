# Fraction.Characters Snippet

I am an absolute fan of the [Alfred](https://duckduckgo.com) app for ~MacOS~ macOS, and I'm pretty that I've only scraped the surface of its capabilities.

In my current role, I create a tonne of documentation so have always looked for ways to speed up the typing of fraction symbols. Let me explain, I stay away from any rich-text editors (which would usually automatically format the text for you) to create the main skeleton of my documentation and rely heavily on Markdown. This way I am totally focused on the semantics of the documents and not the styling, as that gets in the way.

With that created my own snippet collection of fraction symbols, like ½, ⅛, etc. to ease my experience. So, I felt it wise to share this with anyone else who may find this useful.
